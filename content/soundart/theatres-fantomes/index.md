*[Théatres Fantômes](https://grgrcrpntr.bandcamp.com/album/th-tres-fant-mes)* is an immersive sound installation of the [Théâtre Electronique](https://www.yannrocher.org/soundart) collective created for the Belgian sound festival *City Sonics* in Mons. Inspired by haunted places and ghost stories, the installation takes the form of mobiles suspended in the half-light, whose appearance oscillates between an abandoned theater and a shipwreck.

**Yann Rocher** (design & manufacturing), **Antoine Fontaine** (manufacturing), **Galdric Fleury** (manufacturing), **Carl Seleborg** (voice),**Grégoire Carpentier** (composition, electronics).
