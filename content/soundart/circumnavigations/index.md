*Circumnavigations* is a performance imagined by the [Théatre Electronique](https://www.yannrocher.org/soundart) collective as part of the *Jounrées du patrimoine* at the *[Parc Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_Jean-Jacques_Rousseau)* in Ermenonville. The project consists of staging a utopian island factory on Île des Peupliers - where Rousseau was originally buried - using three elements: Two structures to assemble the miniature islands, and a ramp to launch them into the water. At regular intervals, the series of islands are launched onto a lake in a ritual sonified in two ways: The factories emit hammering and machine noises over a long crescendo. At the end of this phase, the islands drift away, emitting a sparkling sound supported by an electric bass solo. The inaccessible manufacture can be listened to and scrutinized from a number of stations on the banks.
