*[Space Opera](https://grgrcrpntr.bandcamp.com/album/space-opera)* is a sound installation by the [Théatre Electronique](https://www.yannrocher.org/soundart) collective, featuring 7 mechanized, sound-enhanced telluriums. It invites the spectator inside a mechanical ballet inspired by the metaphor of the harmony of the spheres. The telluriums are animated by a computer system controlling a series of gears and loudspeakers. With each cycle, a universe is born, develops and dies, according to a different composition of movement and specialized sound.

Coproduced by Opéra de Rennes / Festival Electroni\[k\] / CNC - Dicream.
