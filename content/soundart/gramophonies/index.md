*Gramophonies* is an immersive sound installation of the [Théâtre Electronique collective](https://www.yannrocher.org/soundart) featuring 78 gramophones of various shapes and sizes, equipped with loudspeakers and broadcasting a sort of multi-channel radio tale. The narrative is largely based on texts from Thomas A. Edison's *Diary and Observations*. A voice in American and French, taking up extracts, is spatialized in the installation with other sounds, according to a score defining their position in time and space. Four tableaux follow one another, addressing themes dear to Edison's heart: the invention of the phonograph, man and machine, deafness, the inventor and society.

**Yann Rocher** (design & production), **Andrew Gerzso** (voice), **Hannelore Guittet** (sound recording), **Carl Seleborg** (electronics), **Grégoire Carpentier** (composition, electronics).

Coproduced by City Sonics (BE) & Ministère de la Culture / CNC - Dicream (FR).
