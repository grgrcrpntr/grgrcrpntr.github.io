The members of the Paris-based group [Astrakan](https://astrakan.bandcamp.com/) share the common wish to create sonic atmospheres, using sound as a travelling machine for exploring imaginary scenes. Each piece of Astrakan's repertoire derives from a short scenario that musicians rely on to shape the music. Ranging from jazz, rock to noise and experimental, the sound of Astrakan tells stories without words.

**Stéphane Ghez** (tenor and soprano saxophone), **Grégoire Carpentier** (guitar, electronics, compositions), **Pierre Cassat** (bass, double bass), **Matthew Apted** (drums).
