[Roots Engine](https://rootsengine.com/) is a group of 8 musicians from different parts of France, playing roots reggae tinged with jazz, dub and soul. Buoyed by Eno's lead vocals and brilliant brass riffs, the band's aim is to share music that's different, singular and sincere.

Since the release of their debut LP [Homemade](https://rootsengine.bandcamp.com/album/homemade) in 2015, Roots Engine have been playing a steady stream of concerts, sharing the stage with major artists such as Sinsemilia, Jehro, Kacem Wapalek, Imany, HK et les Saltimbanks, Zion Train, Highlight Tribe, Joe Pilgrim and the Ligerians, Mahom, Marcus Gad, Brain Damage, Harrison Stañfford, La P'tite Fumée and many others.

After various music videos released between 2017 and 2018 (Maybe, Soul Hunter, and Another Reality), the band launched their second album Perpetual Travel, recorded at Wise Studio in March 2018.

A few months later, Roots Engine wins a competition to shoot a live session of an unreleased track (Life is Cool in the Met'Assos studios (Voisins-Le-Bretonneux, 78). In 2019, the band slows down to focus on the composition of their third album Reflections, recorded again at Wise Studio, accompanied by a new video (Not Enough), released on October 16, 2020.
