French Acoustic/Pop band active from 1994 to 2010, in and around Paris, [Les Refuseurs](https://refuseurs.bandcamp.com/) have been writing and recording hundreds of funny, absurd or satyric songs. They used to perform live with a lot of self-derision, turning each gig into a lapse of humour. They disbanded in December 2010, definitely refusing to play any more music.

**Christophe Ozanne** (lead vocals), **Aurélien Acquier** (guitar, backing vocals), **Grégoire Carpentier** (bass), **Antoine Bordry** (drums).
